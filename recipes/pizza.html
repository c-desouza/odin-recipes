    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe of Paneer Pizza is very different than the usual  Paneer Tikka Pizza , in this one paneer cubes are lightly marinated with yogurt and a few spices and it is not the typical spice loaded tikka marinade that is made to make the authentic Paneer Tikka. So the taste and flavor of this Paneer Pizza is different than the tikka version.
    The pizza has the main topping of Indian cottage cheese a.k.a paneer and has both Indian and Italian flavors.
    Vegans don’t worry as this Paneer Pizza can be veganized by just using tofu instead of paneer and a vegan mozzarella cheese.</p>
